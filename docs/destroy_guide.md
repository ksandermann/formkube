# Destroying a Platform

1. Ensure you configured everything as described in the [Bootstrapping Prerequisites](./prerequisites.md)

1. Ensure you configured everything as described in [Configuring Azure Login Credentials](./credentials.md)

1. Run the following inside bash in the repository's root directory:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/destroy.sh
    ```

The following resources will **not** be destroyed when running FormKube's destroy:

1. Backup vault including backups
1. Resource Group defined in *platform_rg_name*
1. DNS zone
1. If *masters_os_disk_delete_on_destroy* is **not** explicitly to *true*, the OS disks of the masters will also not be
destroyed.
1. The Terraform Remote State Backend. To do so, please refer to [Deleting the Backend](./azure_backend.md)

If you want to quickly test various configurations and don't want to manually delete these values after each apply,
check out [FormKube's Development Mode](dev_mode.md).
